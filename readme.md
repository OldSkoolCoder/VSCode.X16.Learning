# VSCode.X16.Learning
This is a Commander X16 Learning GitHub Code Repo, this is where you will get the code we develop on each of the learning series.

To use, load the Workspace into VSCode, you will need to change the **"kickassembler.emulator.runtime"** attribute to point to where you have the Commander X16 emulator.

You should be good to go, by pressing F6 to assemble and run the examples

*Please Note, You must have Kick already SetUp*

Enjoy :D
